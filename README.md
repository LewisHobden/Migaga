## What's this?
This is the repo for my passion project Discord bot. I don't know exactly how many servers it is in - nor how many users it interacts with on a regular basis. I would estimate that it's in the 1000s. It was primarily built as a helper for some of the servers I was in personally. This was before bots were as accessible as they are now, or before the mobile app was as advanced as it is currently. 
I figured I would make the source code public as exposure therapy for my fear of "imperfect" code being made public with my name against it. We're all progressing professionally and personally, chronicling that only helps accelerate the process.. I hope!

## Feature Requests and Support
- I have recently launched a server to get updates on the bot which you can join [here](https://discord.gg/QEwYcsKSrs)!
- You are also welcome can submit Issues on GitHub.

---
## Architecture
- Running on Python 3.9 on Docker.
- Stores data on a MySQL 8.0 database.

To get started contributing, copy `example_config.ini` to `config.ini` and update the ClientId and token to your test bot and you're good to go! 
Schema can be imported from the `storage` directory. I'm working on making that easier.
